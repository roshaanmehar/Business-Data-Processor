# Business-Data-Processor
This repository contains scripts for processing business data from JSON files. The scripts handle phone number normalization, deduplication, and sorting while generating separate output files for records with and without emails. There are implementations in both Python and JavaScript, allowing flexibility based on the preferred runtime environment.
